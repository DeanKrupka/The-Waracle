### *The first ever “social oracle” in Forgotten Runes history*

#### Background:
Forgotten Runes (FR) is a token ecosystem within which Characters and Relics circulate. "Token Interactions" are basically events where Characters and/or Relics get created, transferred, or destroyed. Some FR examples of this are ["The Great Burning"](https://wizzypedia.forgottenrunes.com/The_Great_Burning) and [The Nightmare Imp's Halloween 2022 Event](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/nightmareimp).

#### The Waracle:
This smart contract will govern a token interaction in which Characters can finally get the answer to their question: "Who is my enemy?" 

Perched atop his fortified bunker, The Waracle will reveal to any Wizard, Warrior, or Soul who, in the Runiverse, is *their* mortal enemy. He’ll log the enemy pair onchain, and update their Book of Lore (through the use of addLoreWithScribe on BoL contract). This Lore entry will chronicle the Character’s visit to The Waracle and depict the name and likeness of their respective enemy.

#### The Battle on the Horizon:
The Lore entry that Characters add to their Book of Lore will create anticipation for an impending battle between the enemies: “A battle is on the horizon. Choices will need to be made.”
